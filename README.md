# SmartCabinet

Just a random project made using Kivy, I made this about 2 years ago when my knowledge of kivy and Application Development in general was not that strong but still this project might help someone. Please use `Python2` for this.

Screens Implemented till now:

    - Inventory Screen
    - Filter Screen.
    - Dialog Popup.
    - Material Screen.
    - Menu Screen.
    - Episode Screen.

## how to run?

```
cd SmartCabinet
python main.py
```
